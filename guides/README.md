# Guides

Short, focused guides for common Rails workflows and getting started.

- **Purpose:** Step-by-step walkthroughs (e.g. “Your first Rails API”, “Setting up background jobs”).
- **Relationship to docs:** The [docs/](../docs/) folder holds the full Q&A reference; guides here are narrative and task-oriented.

*Guides can be added over time. Suggest new ones via an issue or pull request.*
