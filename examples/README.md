# Examples

Code snippets and small, runnable examples referenced by the documentation.

- **Purpose:** Copy-paste or runnable samples for controllers, models, jobs, config, etc.
- **Formats:** Ruby (`.rb`), ERB, or small Rails app snippets. Keep examples minimal and focused.

*Add examples here when you contribute new Q&A or guides that benefit from standalone code.*
